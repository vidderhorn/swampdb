# SwampDB

> Node/TypeScript document database library built on Postgres.

- Early project.
- Starting with ideas and code from [Rob Conery's blog](https://rob.conery.io/2020/02/05/postgres-for-those-who-cant-even-part-2-working-with-node-and-json/) and [dox](https://github.com/robconery/dox) project. [Massive](https://massivejs.org/) will be good reference as it also contains a document database API.
